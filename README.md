# E-commerce

This is a project built during the Skylab bootcamp.

The App is a full responsive E-Commerce Web App with some hardware products in which you can:

- See a list with a filter of types.
- See the detail of every product.
- Inside the detail, add the product to the cart.
- See the cart with or without products.
- Add more units of a product if at least there is one unit.
- Remove units of a product. If the removed unit is the last, the product is removed from the cart.
- The cart is stored in the database, actually without user login.
